#  HR Analytics Project – Equip 11 (IT Academy Final Project)

This repository contains the final project developed by **Equip 11** during the **IT Academy Data Bootcamp**, focusing on **HR analytics**. Our goal was to use data science techniques to gain insights into employee performance and absenteeism by combining **internal HR data** with **external social and environmental factors**.

---

## Project Summary

We analyzed performance and absenteeism trends within an organization by merging internal datasets (HR records, evaluations, attendance) with external sources (weather, holidays, economic indicators).  
The aim was to discover actionable insights that could help HR departments reduce absenteeism and improve workplace efficiency.
